"""Build the DKBB GameCube/Bongos controller patch (RDKE01, USA) in two forms:
     1. Gecko code text (Dolphin .ini / .gct source)
     2. a static main.dol patch (writes straight into the baked C2 code body --
        the DOL's own codehandler-installer applies the hook at runtime, same
        as it already does for the codeA-D hooks; no codecave/trampoline needed)

Two poller variants, chosen at patch time -- see README for the tradeoff:

  autopoll (default): programs SI hardware auto-polling (SIC0OUTBUF + SIPOLL
    enable bits) so the console's own SI logic fills SIC0INBUFH/L each frame.
    Zero changes to codeA-D -- only the poller body changes.

  stash: doesn't touch SIPOLL at all. Issues an SI immediate transfer and
    stashes the response (read from the I/O buffer at 0xCD006480, which
    Dolphin and real hardware implement identically) into codeD's unused
    leading pad words at 0x800027A4/0x800027A8, then repoints codeA-D's
    reads there instead of the hardware-only SIC0INBUFH/L registers.
    Needs 10 extra word patches inside codeA-D.

Both were sized to exactly 27 words + 1 spare (28 total, NN=0xE) so either
drops into the poller's C2 slot without shifting anything after it -- that
matters because the injected code list fills its segment with zero slack.

The root bug this fixes: SIC0INBUFH/L are hardware-written auto-poll result
registers. Software stores to them (what the original v24 poller did) are
silently ignored on real silicon -- Dolphin merely doesn't model that, which
is why the original patches worked in an emulator and nowhere else.
